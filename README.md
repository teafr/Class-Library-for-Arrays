# Class Library for Arrays

#### [Example of using](https://github.com/teafr/Collection-of-practice/tree/practice_with_ref_out_and_enum)

### Why you use it
If you have a lot of operations with arrays, you're gonna need something that'll make your code smaller and understandable. 
In this case you can use my ArrayTool to save your time.

### How it works
Class is static, so you don't have to create an object.
You can just type ArrayTool and dot, then you'll see how much choises you have.

### What exactly you can do with help of ArrayTool
You can Show array, fill it with random numbers (or input from console), add element by index, delete element by index, sort, find index of element. 

### Tecnical info
I used Class Library to create this project. I've made overloads and documentations for each public method. 
Also I didn't forget about validations. 
For some methods Algoritms and Data Stuctures knowlage required, so I've got acquainted with it. I'm planning to add more Sort methods.
